üèÜ Recognized as an OpenCV OAK-D Finalist.
üèÜ Contributed to multiple features in the 4Art application to digitize the artwork industry, which has over 350,000 users.
üèÜ I worked on a product called Workhub that received the Golden Kitty Award in 2022 and a high performer award on G2, when it was launched.

I am a Data Scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and more than three years of professional experience. My expertise spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and MLOps empowering me to create intelligent systems that deliver real-world impact.

Here's a glimpse of what I bring to the table:

Areas of expertise:
- NLP (Text classification, Text Summarization, Chatbots, Prompt engineering, LLM)
- Computer vision (Object detection, Object tracking, Object classification, OCR, Image Processing, RTSP)
- MLOps (API devlopment, Model/Pipeline deployment, Model optimization, Edge devices compatible scripts, Containerization)


Tech Stack:
- Python (Scikit-learn, Langchain, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Unstructured, PyPDF, Numpy, Pandas)
- Deeplearning Development Frameworks (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras)
- API Development (Flask, FastAPI)
